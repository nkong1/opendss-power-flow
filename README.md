**OpenDSS Microgrid Power Flow Modeling**

This repo was used for modeling the distributional system impacts of a proposed 712 kW microgrid at Clemson University for NREL's Solar District Cup '25-26. I competed with Berkeley's Undergraduate & Resources Collaborative Undergraduate (BERCU) oragnization.

Results from the power flow simulations were used to demonstrate the stability of the Clemson's existing distribution system with the proposed PV projects. All bus voltages remain within 4% of their rated voltage and all distribution lines experiences <43% loading at every hour of the model year (2023).
